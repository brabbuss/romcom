## Introduction
[The RomCom website](https://brabbuss.github.io/romcom/) aims to put on display the fledgling developer skills of Turing students learned by their second week, and doing so in an entertaining format. The project forces students to manipulate elements on the DOM using only JS - the CSS and HTML files were not manipulated in any way.

The site lets users generate random book covers that pull from an array of preset titles, tagline descriptors, and images. Users can save the covers they enjoy and view them later in the "View Saved Covers" section. In addition, users can also create their own custom book covers in the "Make Your Own Cover" section, which can also be saved to view later.

### Generate Random Cover
Upon page load, a random cover will be generated, drawing on an array of titles, cover images and tagline descriptors 'under the hood'. Clicking on "Show new random cover" in the navigation bar at the top of the site will generate - you guessed it - a new, random book cover!

### Create Custom Cover
Users can create their very own custom cover! Clicking "Make Your Own Cover" in the nav bar will take the user to a screen with four input fields:

* **Cover** - In this field, enter the url for an image you'd like to use as your cover image
* **Title** - Enter the desired title for the custom cover. The title will be displayed on the book cover
* **First and Second Descriptor** Enter one descriptor in each field. These descriptors will be inserted into a tagline displayed on the book cover

After filling in these fields, click the "Make my book" button at the bottom of the page to generate and view the custom cover. Click "Save Cover" in the navigation bar to save the cover to an array of saved covers.

### Save Current Cover
The "Save Cover" button in the nav bar will save the current random or user generated cover to an array of saved covers. These saved covers can be accessed in the "View Saved Covers" section at any time.

### View Saved Covers
Navigate to the "View Saved Covers" section by clicking the "View Saved Covers" button in the navigation bar. This section will display all covers that were previously saved with the "Save Cover" function (clicking the "Save Cover" button). *It is important to note that all saved covers will be cleared if the page is refreshed*

### Roadmap
* In future iterations, to be able to delete any saved cover by double-clicking the cover
  * The team was able to implement functionality to delete a cover upon double-clicking, however there were bugs that were not able to be squashed by the project due date
